I believe that our country offers very important advantages especially for international investors who are looking for alternatives to the asia based production network
our door is open to all those who have ideas and constructive criticisms for turkeys growth and strengthening
I would like to underline that  in eighteen years we have never seen international entrepreneurs as foreign investors we provide the same opportunities what we provide for our people to all entrepreneurs who trust turkey and believe in turkeys investment environment 
we encourage investments that will lead turkeys technological transformation with high added value from defense industry to food digital economy to health sector
I say to investors around the world come and realize turkish hospitality I want you to know that our respective ministries and the presidential investment office are ready to offer you all the support you need
as turkey we have acted in cooperation with the international community since the first days of the pandemic in addition to the un we have always been at the forefront of activities in the who g20 mikta the turkic council the organization of islamic  cooperation and other international platforms to date we have provided assistance to one hundred and fifty six countries and nine international organizations
we support countries and regions that have food safety problems in the conditions of the pandemic and carry out special programs in sixteen countries for disadvantaged groups like the elderly disabled and orphans in some developing countries we organize training programs for the production of personal protective materials using local resources
we are trying to provide budget support to some countries facing economic difficulties due to the pandemic to date more than fifty turkish companies have supported more than twenty countries in the fight against the pandemic in various ways
the three point six million syrians under our protection can benefit from health services in our country just like our citizens
we have supported the debt deferral initiative initiated by the g20 platform of which we are a member from the beginning
the outside world do not show turkeys international achievements and the great change it has experienced within the country fairly in many cases our achievements are conveyed in a different way than they are by being ignored and distorted 
when the same events happened later in different countries in europe the people who taught us about freedom of the press ignored the events they ignored yellow vests protestors in paris they made no mention of the disproportionate interventions of the french police they did not make a single critical sentence in the face of the blockade of the media by french state bodies 
we see that a similar double standard repeats in the practices of israeli security forces against palestinians palestinian children slaughtered in the middle of the street the are not worthy for news in these independent media outlets
it is truly shameful that media outlets support islamophobia and xenophobia 
if this attitude is not stopped all mankind will suffer with europe 
as muslims this year we are not only fighting with the pandemic but also the rising hostility for islam in western countries
as for today unlawfulness towards muslims has become an ordinary case in many western countries which are the dishonest supporters of the democracy in fact islam and muslim hostility have become a policy for the head of state in some european countries 
fighting with islamophobia and xenophobia is our responsibility to our brothers and sisters living in that land
theres no doubt the way to do that is through our unity of power 
on the other hand the more we produce as islamic countries the more we strengthen our economies the more the weight of our promise will increase
we have provided medical supplies and equipment to all requesting countries and international organizations without any discriminations so far we have provided our assistance to one hundred and fifty six countries and nine international organizations including forty four from the islamic world 
turkey has hosted the largest number of refugees in the world for the last six years we host more than four million foreigners who are mostly syrians in our country we also provide humanitarian aid and protection to millions of people in need within syria in idlib and many more 
these figures more than the population of many of our major cities we continue our efforts to make those who seek refuge in our country live in harmony with our society and in a manner worthy of human dignity 
we continue these efforts with determination although the promises of support given to us have not been largely kept now we expect everyone to share responsibility fairly
we first try to ensure our own national security the safety of life and property of our own citizens and then contribute to the stability peace and internal peace of our region 
we are doing our best to eliminate the threat of terrorism prevent conflicts and strengthen stability
we are the only nato country in syria that has fought daesh directly although we were left alone we have captured and sent to back nearly nine thousand foreign terrorist fighters so far
we have banned nearly one hundred thousand people from entering our country which we have identified their relationships to conflict areas 
we made it safe the areas where terrorists were for more than four hundred eleven thousand syrian brothers and sisters to return to their homelands.
our training and advisory support to the libyan government of national accord has prevented the country from being dragged into further civil war
despite the provocations of greece and the greek administration of southern cyprus we have always been patient about the eastern mediterranean issue we contributed to the end of thirty years of occupation in nagorno karabakh
as turkey we are actively contributing to the fight against climate change although we have little historical responsibility in the same way we take the necessary measures for the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity in our country with our sixteen point five billion dollar investment in the last five years we have ensured that approximately forty nine percent of  turkeys installed power capacity in energy consists of renewable sources we produce sixty three percent of our electricity from domestic and renewable sources we rank thirteenth in the world and seventh in europe in solar installed power
no country in todays world has the luxury of considering security issues according to geographical distance the fate of europe is no longer independent of africas and north americas fate is not independent of south americas
today most of the crises that threaten global stability are happening in our region as turkey we are fighting the worlds most bloody terrorist organizations at the same time from Daesh to pkk ypg from feto to dhkpc 
in all the problems in our region the attitude of our country is always in favor of being part of the solution  not the problem with this view we continue to stand with our friends and brothers and sisters everywhere from syria to libya from the eastern mediterranean to the caucasus
as a country that has been fighting divisive terrorism for thirty five years we have shown a principled and consistent stance on terrorism that is the greatest threat to global security
thanks to these operations we have cleared more than eight thousand two hundred square kilometers from terrorism thanks to the steps we have taken we have ensured that more than four hundred eleven thousand syrian brothers and sisters return home voluntarily and safely we have significantly eliminated the threat from the pkk ypg terrorist group while ending daeshs dominance of the area
it is interesting that the terrorists we captured and handed over to foreign security units can make an act of terrorism today
unfortunately turkey has been left alone not only in its fight against the pkk and daesh but also in its fight against foreign terrorist fighters
likewise our country has had to deal with almost all of the irregular migration from syria alone 
none of the promises made to our country which has been hosting three point six million syrian asylum seekers for nearly nine years have been fulfilled
as turkey we never have an expansionist understanding when dealing with the problems around us
we have no interest in the land sovereignty internal affairs of any country we first try to ensure our own national security the safety of life and property of our own citizens and then to contribute to the stability peace and internal peace of our region
the nagorno karabakh issue is an important example at this point
thanks to our joint efforts with the russian federation we both ended a hot conflict and contributed to the solution of a problem that has been unsolved for thirty years
if the hope for a political solution have been increased again in libya today turkeys timely intervention has contributed significantly
despite the provocations of greece and the greek administration of southern cyprus we have always been patient on the eastern mediterranean issue 
with an excuse of solidarity within the union, the eus accusations of exploration and drilling activities in the eastern mediterranean which we are doing determinedly to protect our own rights and the interests of the turkish cypriots are incompatible with history law and facts 
we will continue our efforts to end the isolations against the turkish cypriots and to share the hydrocarbon resources fairly in the eastern mediterranean with the same determination
we have never opposed to dialogue and diplomacy and we do not our proposal to organize an eastern mediterranean conference which will be attended by the turkish cypriots is a manifestation of our will to solve the problem with dialogue
turkey has always shown a constructive stance to overcome the current problems in the aegean and eastern mediterranean 
as a matter of fact in the past months at the initiative of the nato secretary general we have actively and sincerely participated and contributed to the separation talks between our country and greece under nato we also agreed with greece to restart the process of negotiations on the aegean issues which took place four point five years ago lastly 
we cannot afford to ignore the east or the west 
we never neglect asia and africa while developing our relations with europe we do not see our deepening cooperation with russia as an alternative to our deep rooted ties with america
we give great importance to our position within nato of which we have been a member for sixty eight years turkeys borders are also natos borders 
turkey has the will to continue its determined struggle in the face of threats to international security and stability
we also offered support to thirty eight thousand foreigners from ninety countries who want to return home from turkey we have provided medical supplies to one hundred and fifty five countries and nine international organizations that requested help from our country we did this assistance not as a public diplomacy activity but as a requirement of our faith culture and entrepreneurial and humanitarian foreign policy line
with our operations in syria we not only removed daesh and pkk ypg terrorists from our borders but also ensured the return of our four hundred eleven thousand syrian brothers and sisters who had sought refuge in turkey
with our presence in idlib we have prevented a new humanitarian tragedy and a great wave of migration we are housed four point five million refugees in our country and we are caring for many of them in syria there is no other country like this in the world only turkey does this
in addition to our presence in syria we also continue our efforts for a political solution on the basis of syrias territorial integrity and political unity
we weakened the separatist terrorist organization for our operations in iraq
we hope that the eu will get rid of the strategic blindness that has driven turkey away as soon as possible.
even turkey wants to it cannot escape the responsibility of its brothers and sisters in the geography which extends from the balkans to turkistan from africa to the middle east 
even turkey wants to it unable to ignore palestine somalia yemen bosnia afghanistan pakistan arakan we could not and did not remain silent on the occupation of azerbaijani territory where we shared one nation two states principle
likewise we will not leave the palestinian people alone in their honorable fight against all oppression violence and occupation
fighting with islamophobia is a requirement of both our faith and our responsibility to our citizens abroad
those who do not declare the slightest sadness for the dozens of our teachers who were martyred by pkk terrorism who hosted the ringleaders of the ypg in palaces with red carpets have no value in questioning our attitude
turkey is one of the most principled determined countries in the world in the fight against terrorism
we announced to our nation on august twenty first the good news that three hundred and twenty billion cubic meters of natural gas were found in the first two layers of the well under the sea floor at the end of the test analysis and detailed engineering studies an additional eight five billion cubic meters were added to the reserve we discovered thus bringing the total reserve of the sakarya field in the danube one region to four hundred and five billion cubic meters
the hydrocarbon resources we discovered are of course very important in economic value because turkey is a clear importing country in this regard
we import natural gas from russia iran and azerbaijan lng ie liquefied natural gas from places such as algeria qatar nigeria and america even there are small amounts of oil and natural gas coming out in various parts of our country which is quite inadequate in our total consumption the reserve we discovered in the black sea is the largest hydrocarbon source of our country to date with these discoveries which I believe will continue hopefully our countrys commitment to the outside in natural gas will be significantly reduced
we have no interest in any countrys right their law especially their land we are only in defense of our own rights we are determined to use all of our power along with all the ways of diplomacy to make this fight a success
the way to provide peace and stability in the eastern mediterranean is to respect recognize and give the rights of turkey and the turkish republic of northern cyprus and we will not allow any other tyranny and plays
the credibility of the eu had already diminished due to the double standard it has applied to our country at the expense of all the values it has defended so far and if it does not have a fair stance in the eastern mediterranean in the current debates this will now be officially a declaration of the end of the eu
nevertheless we are in favor of developing and maintaining our political economic and cultural relations that has ancient historical backgrounds with Europe the only question waiting for an answer here is whether the eu wants it or not.
we responded to the call for support of one hundred and fifty four different countries and eight international organizations in the world without discrimination positively among the states where we support medical equipment and supplies are forty six african countries 
despite logistical difficulties and quarantine measures our companies in africa continued to work with dedication during the pandemic period according to the normalization steps our companies have also accelerated their activities
turkish airlines which flew to forty countries and sixty points prior to the pandemic restarted its flights to thirty three different points in twenty seven african countries
dakar blaise diagne international airport which opened three years ago is the best example of this turkish contractors completed the construction left by a foreign company for eight years in eight months and presented it to the benefit of our senegalese brothers and sisters  
when we took the first steps of the african expansion in two thousand three we received many criticisms from inside and outside despite the common history of more than a thousand years unfortunately turkey and africa seemed very far away from each other there were many unreal obstacles between our countries prejudices prevented the truth we started by first of all by breaking down these prejudices 
we have worked to get our african brothers and sisters to know our country more closely and to discover turkeys potential
we have increased the number of embassies from twelve on the continent to forty two and the number of our trade consultancies to twenty six 
the number of african embassies in ankara also increased from ten to thirty six in addition to our diplomatic missions we have expanded our presence on the continent with our institutions such as tika yunus emre institute maarif foundation anadolu agency turkish airlines
I visited twenty eight african countries during my presidency I became the first leader to visit somalia with my wife in two thousand eleven when the international community ignored the drama of millions of people
we signed trade and economic cooperation agreements with forty two countries and mutual incentive and protection of investments agreements with 30 countries in addition we have signed double taxation prevention agreements with 13 countries and a free trade agreement with five african countries
as a result of all these efforts our trade volume reached twenty six point two billion dollar in two thousand nineteen from five point four billion dollar with the african continent in two thousand three our exports to the continent were only two point one billion dollar in two thousand three compared to sixteen point six billion dollar as of two thousand nineteen
turkey which has thousand year old ancient ties to the continent is the fateful partner of africans the essence of our relations with africa is sincerity brotherhood solidarity we never pursue short term interests we want to win together we want to achieve together we do not approve of wanting to maintain old colonial habits with new methods as a country without the history of colonialism we reject the arrogant commanding view of the continent
we see that azerbaijan is also very determined to liberate its territory as turkey we support azerbaijans rightful struggle to reclaim its territory with all our hearts we call on all countries that defend justice and fairness to support azerbaijan our african friends have always reacted strongly to the occupation especially the palestinian case I believe that you will stand with azerbaijan in liberating nagorno karabakh from occupation
the republic of turkey has shown the world that it cares about the rights and interests of turkish cypriots like its own rights and interests
for us there are two dimensions to the eastern mediterranean issue the first one is to protect turkey's continental shelf rights and the second one is to guarantee turkish cypriots' natural resources rights and interests around the island.
turkey the rising star of its region and the world will compensate for the injustices long suffered by turkish cypriots as it achieves its goals 
we are determined to continue our struggle until we make the turkish republic of northern cyprus an equal and honorable member of the global system politically and economically
I once again condemn armenia which attacked azerbaijani territory yesterday turkey will continue to stand by friend and brother azerbaijan with all its possibilities and heart
especially the minsk triad america russia france have not solved this problem for nearly thirty years and they have done their best not to solve this problem 
they threaten from time to time what is the threat is Turkey here do you have any turkish soldiers here those who say so are those who carry thousands of truck guns there in our south especially in northern syria 
mediterranean peace does not come out if turkey and the turkish republic of northern cyprus are not fairly involved
under the name of european solidarity international law has been ignored that is why we started to move forward in our own way since two thousand eighteen
we have no interest in anyones rights but we cannot let others to be ignored our rights
our primary choice is to resolve disputes through dialogue on the basis of international law fairly for this purpose we have also said that we are ready for dialogue with greece especially without any prerequisites we also proposed to organize a conference in which all people in the region will attend including turkish cypriots about considering all countries rights in the region 
we have seen once again the rightness of the thesis that the world is greater than five the fate of humanity cannot be left to the minds of limited number of countries in order to prevent the loss of reputation in international organizations we must first review our mindset institutions and rules
as turkey we have called for cooperation on all international platforms since the first days of the pandemic crisis at the g20 at the turkic council in mikta in the organization of islamic cooperation and on other platforms, we were at the fore of the efforts to combat the pandemic 
we reached out to one hundred and forty six countries and seven international organizations that requested medical supplies 
with our evacuation operations we have ensured the return of more than one hundred thousand citizens from one hundred and forty one countries to their homes
in the same campaigns more than five thousand five hundred foreigners from sixty seven countries went back to their homeland
as an international community we cannot find a permanent solution to the syrian issue without the same principled attitude towards all terrorist organizations and without a determined stance this approach is also essential for safe and voluntary returns to syria 
the return of over four hundred eleven thousand syrian brothers to the areas we have rescued from the terrorist group in syria is the clearest indication of this 
in the same way thanks to the regions we have made safe we have prevented millions of syrians from leaving their homelands from various parts of the country especially idlib for years turkey has housed nearly four million syrian asylum seekers on its territory meeting all their needs we also meet the needs of syrians in the areas we control especially in places close to our border finally we are building ten thousand briquette houses for these brothers in idlib and elsewhere we carry out all these activities with our own means and with the support of our people without considerable support from the international community and international organizations resolving the conflict in syria on the basis of the un security council resolution two thousand two hundred fifty four should be a priority for all of us
for this the political process initiated especially under the auspices of the un owned and directed by syrians needs to be successfully concluded This is the only way syria can achieve a lasting peace with its territorial integrity and political unity preserved Until this goal is realized we are determined to prevent terrorist organizations that are threatening our national security and the political unity and territorial integrity of syria
unfortunately some states including some european countries violate the rights of asylum seekers and migrants  it is time for the un to take a strong stand in the face of these violations that have violated the geneva convention and the international human rights system
it is also the responsibility of the international community to stop the conflict of yemen that is continuing for more than five years and to prevent the humanitarian crisis
it is our sincere desire for iraq not to become a conflict zone for external forces
and also it is our sincere desire for iraq to be in a position that manages stability and prosperity for our region
while we support our neighbor Iraq in all areas we want to cooperate more closely especially in the fight against terrorism
we expect sincere cooperation from the international community and this country in eradicating the pkk terrorist organization that is staying in Iraq just like daesh clearing the region from terrorist organizations will contribute to the future of Iraq that is the home to humanitys most ancient geography
we are in favor of resolving issues related to irans nuclear program through diplomacy and dialogue considering international law
as turkey we will not support any plan that the palestinian people do not consent to
the palestinian issue can only be resolved by the establishment of an independent sovereign and geographically continuous state of palestine which has east jerusalem as its capital on the basis of the nineteen sixty seven borders Other than that the search for solutions is futile one sided unfair
armenia which attacked azerbaijani territory in july has once again proved to be the biggest obstacle to lasting peace and stability in the south caucasus
the kashmir issue key to south asias stability and peace is still waiting for a solution 
we are in favor of resolving this issue through dialogue within the framework of un resolutions and especially in line with the expectations of the kashmiri people
we have no interest in anyones interests or law in the eastern mediterranean or any other region however we cannot allow the rights of our country and the turkish cypriots to be violated and their interests ignored
it is our priority choice to resolve disputes in accordance with the basis of international law with sincere dialogue 
we will never tolerate any imposition harassment attack to the contrary
as a guarantor country we have never left the turkish cypriot people alone in their rightful case and we will not leave them an after that a solution to the cyprus issue is only possible by accepting the fact that the turkish cypriot people co-own the island we will support any solution that permanently guarantees the security of the turkish cypriot people and their historical and political rights on the island
another important issue on which we have to act together is climate change
we see how human interference with the balances of nature can lead to heavy costs 
although we have little historical responsibility at the point reached as turkey we sincerely support this struggle and fulfill our obligations
while xenophobia has increased during the pandemic violent acts against vulnerable people especially migrants and asylum seekers, have accelerated the most important responsible for this dangerous acceleration are politicians who turn to populist discourses for the sake of votes and marginalized ones that legitimize hate speech by misusing freedom of expression I urgently invite all international organizations to take more concrete steps in the fight against this mentality
we showed that we stood with the iranian people with the medical equipment and relief supplies we sent in the early stages of the pandemic
energy is not only the main element of development but also it is very important for the national sovereignty
nearly all chaos wars conflicts in the world for the last century are dependent with energy think about what has happened in recent years in syria when we were going to the places where the victim people were someone directly went for the oil production facilities we encountered the same situation in libya behind the eastern mediterranean issue there is the fight over the energy resources sharing
turkey now has the will and resources to stand on its own without the need of anyone in any field 
we will continue not to be interested in others rights but also we will not let anyone to ignore our rights 
as turkey we have helped our friends and brothers and sisters as well as provide the best health care to our citizens in the process of fighting the pandemic we have provided medical assistance and supplies to one hundred and thirty seven countries around the world we managed to get our daily deaths down to sixteen
our main priorities are maintaining syrias political unity and territorial integrity establishing peace and finding a lasting political solution to the conflict 
as turkey we have stood by our syrian brothers and sisters since the beginning of the conflict regardless of ethnic identity origin faith we welcomed millions of syrian asylum seeker  
while countries whose opportunities are more than us set quotas for refugees we welcomed everyone without discrimination  
we have carried out comprehensive policies in almost every field from housing to health from education to social integration for them however in this process we did not get any support from countries especially the eu which define itself as the advocate of democracy and human rights the promises made to turkey was not kept and our country was left alone 
migrants who were able to travel to europe were victims of racist discriminatory and hostile policies last years inhumane images on the turkish greek border are an example for some western countries to show their view of migrants
leaving aside our prejudices about migration I believe we should see the contribution of migrants to the countries and communities they go to
we have developed a cooperation model on the basis of win-win by making clearing agreements through central banks with countries where our trade relations are intense 
in addition to meeting our own needs we try to be there for our brothers and sisters 
we consider the requests from you as a priority we are very pleased to see that the necessary solidarity and cooperation has also been established among the council members the turkic council has already proven to be a useful platform to make our cooperation in this area more efficient
since the pandemic began we have ensured the return of more than twenty five thousand citizens from sixty four countries to our country and we show you the necessary conveniences at the point of flight for the evacuation of your citizens in turkey we have decided not to take criminal action against foreigners who violated visas and residence permits during the measures I believe that you will provide similar flexibilities within the scope of possible evacuations of turkish citizens
I believe that this epidemic reminds us all of this fact our languages our religions our countries are different but we all have common destiny none of us have the luxury of implementing protectionist and unilateral policies 
the coronavirus pandemic has once again revealed the importance of the spirit of cooperation and reconciliation of the g20
the peace spring operation we organized in northern syria in october again had very strong support from the state of pakistan and its people when dishonest countries which define themselves democratic and human rights seekers tried to save the terrorists while pakistan stood by turkey in its rightful struggle
we are following pakistans efforts in the fight against terrorism pakistan is a country that has suffered a lot from instability terrorism and conflict in the region as a country which has been the target of the world's most violent organizations like daesh pkk and feto and has been fighting divisive terrorism for 35 years we understand the challenges facing pakistan we will continue to support pakistan in its fight against terrorism
especially in the recent step between mr trump and netanyahu regarding jerusalem the plan that was announced as the peace plan of the last century in the middle east is not a peace plan but an occupation project
by claiming kashmir at the seventy fourth un general assembly we once again revealed our countrys sensitivity in this matter
we consider pakistans positive contributions to the afghanistan peace process very valuable as turkey we provide the necessary support to pakistan and afghanistan both of whom are our brothers in this process
turkeys direct investments in pakistan reach five hundred million dollar I am very pleased that turkish companies operate in pakistan in many areas like energy food cleaning construction
we prefer to call it international investment rather than foreign investment because in our understanding, capital has no nationality so capital nationalism is not the right approach we see no difference between international companies investing in turkey and our own companies
we have opened our doors to anyone who believes in the investment potential of our country and we will continue to open them we run a model where we grant citizenship to international entrepreneurs in exchange for real estate investment under certain conditions
it would be very beneficial to implement projects that will connect pakistan with the central asian geography such as the turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan india natural gas pipeline the turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan electric power transmission line
likewise we know that turkish series which reach hundreds of millions of audiences worldwide are followed with interest in pakistan we can further develop our cooperation in the cinema and series sector under the leadership of trt our other institutions and companies
I have learned that the pakistani people prefer western countries for treatment however it is now needed to change this habit turkey has made a great progress in its health infrastructure and has become one of the main destinations of world health tourism 
turkey is far ahead of the west in both service and prices compliance
last year we hosted five hundred thousand people from abroad for the health tourism in our country the new route of our pakistani brothers and sisters should be turkey which provides you the same treatment services at much more affordable prices and in a friendly environment
ukraine is a friendly country for us and also it is a strategic partner
in two thousand nineteen our trade increased by ten point two percent to four point eight billion dollar the turkish contracting sector has signed one hundred and eighty four projects in ukraine worth a total of six point two billion dollar so far
turkey has become one of the main destinations of ukraine in health tourism in recent years last year twenty thousand people came to our country from ukraine for treatment
we have also achieved great momentum in the tourism sector we have removed visas between our countries and made it possible to travel with identity cards thus in two thousand nineteen we hosted one million five hundred fifty thousand ukrainian tourists in turkey during the same period two hundred seventeen thousand citizens from turkey visited Ukraine 
as turkey we have never seen and do not see international entrepreneurs as foreign investors 
we see them as global investors and in this way we provide and will provide the same opportunities that we provide to our own people to entrepreneurs who trust turkey and believe in turkeys investment environment
in the last seventeen years there has been a direct international capital inflow of two hundred and twenty billion dollar into our economy
today turkish airlines which reaches one hundred and twenty six countries and three hundred and twenty eight international flight points is one of the airlines that flies to the most countries and most international points in the world
our three billion dollar investment is a manifestation of our countrys and our companies trust in ukraine 
In the last seventy years we have opened many international works from high speed train lines to airports tunnels to highways bridges to tanap turkstream baku tbilisi kars railway
the number of people coming to our country for treatment reached four hundred seventy thousand in the first ten months of two thousand nineteen from four hundred fifty thousand in two thousand eighteen
in the field of tourism we see that we broke our own record in two thousand nineteen
we give importance to improving our relations with senegal which is both an important partner and a valued friend for Turkey 
turkey a member of the g20 and an important economic power in its region is an important market for senegalese producers senegal on the other hand has the potential for a serious re exportation for turkish business
turkish contracting firms have had so far twenty nine projects worth seven hundred and seventy five million dollar in senegal
I want senegalese investors to trust turkey and to believe in turkeys possible investment environment our doors are always open to our senegalese brothers and sisters as they are to all investors in the world likewise I know that senegals doors are open to turkish entrepreneurs
with turkey scholarships we provide undergraduate graduate and doctoral education to four thousand five hundred african students
beyond being a friendly and brotherly country we see algeria as one of our strategic partners in north africa 
our countrys view of this land is never the product of unilateral enthusiasm for gain it has not been we want to produce together move forward together enrich together
turkish companies have signed three hundred and seventy seven projects worth sixteen point one billion dollar in algeria so far
like others we are not only selling products to algeria but also making long term investments that will provide employment in this
with these investments turkish entrepreneurs offer jobs to approximately ten thousand algerian brothers and sisters 
mrs merkelss contributions to youth exchange programs education and cultural cooperation between turkey and germany exceed twenty five years I would like to thank the german authorities on behalf of my country and my nation for owning our university like the german high school which has one point five centuries history I especially wish that the turkish german university would become a symbol of turkish and german friendship
the increasing number of international students indicates that turkey is on its way to becoming a global brand in this field as well 
our number of international students has reached one hundred seventy two thousand from fifteen thousand
workings on the establishment of joint universities such as turkish japanese university of science and technology turkish italian university are continuing in our country
what happened in syria yemen iraq libya once again showed the fateful partnership of the geography we are in
not only neighboring countries like us but also whole europe specifcally germany have been affected by the ongoing conflict in syria for the past nine years if peace is not achieved quickly in there the chaos in libya will affect the entire mediterranean area 
turkstream is a historical project that we have put a lot of effort into together with our russian friends both in the context of our bilateral relations and the energy map in our region
thanks to the project fifteen point seventy five cubic meters of thirty one point five billion cubic meters of natural gas will reach our country directly without any intermediary 
Turkey has the tenth largest energy market among oecd countries.
russia is one of the leading natural gas suppliers in our country In the past thirty three years we have supplied approximately four hunred billion cubic meters of natural gas from the russian federation this is the best example of win-win based cooperation based on the mutual interest of our countries
we see that european countries are paying great attention to russian gas from the second line under the project as turkey with our investments in recent years we have reached the infrastructure that will create an important natural gas supply capacity and trade center for the regionss geography together and for ourselves
a month ago we officially opened tanap one of the most strategic lines of our region with my dear brother azerbaijani president aliyev with tanap which is seen as the silk road of energy we offered sixteen billion cubic meters of azerbaijani natural gas to the benefit of turkey and europe in the following years we plan to increase tanaps carrying capacity to twenty four billion cubic meters and hopefully then to thirty one billion cubic meters
our goal is to make our country one of the global energy centers as turkey we are definitely not looking for regional tensions and we never have been the only purpose of our hydrocarbon exploration activities in the eastern mediterranean is to protect the interests of our country and the turkish republic of northern cyprus
the ongoing tension between our ally the united states and our neighbor iran has reached a point we never desired as turkey 
we do not want iraq syria lebanon or the gulf region where more than thirty percent of the energy trade by sea is carried out to become the scene of custody wars
the safety of the iraqi turkmens is just as important to us as the safety of our own citizens
we have supported Iraq in all areas in the fight against daesh and pkk terrorism
with the understanding that the world is greater than five we fight for the common interests of all humanity in all areas with this understanding we increased our effectiveness in the world by raising our number of foreign representatives from two hundred and forty two in two thousand eighteen to two hundred and forty six
we signed the memorandum of understanding on security and military Cooperation and the memorandum of understanding on the limitation of maritime jurisdictions with the libyan government of national accord on november twenty seven two thousand nineteen 
we will continue our efforts towards this country in order to protect the territorial integrity of iraq and its political unity to fight terrorist organizations to improve investment and trade to protect the rights of iraqi turkmens we have improved our comprehensive cooperation with qatar our strategic partner in the gulf with the highest level of efforts
we continued our fight against the extensions of terrorist organizations threatening turkey abroad continuously 
we have made intensive efforts to improve international and interagency cooperation
we have worked hard with high level contacts to improve our bilateral relations with places where we have important relations such as eu countries russia and the united states
we currently provide scholarships to sixteen thousand students from all over the world
